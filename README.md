Data Processing and Display Project

Project :
1- Reads and processes data from a CSV file.
2- Updates the database with the processed data.
3- Fetches data from the database and displays it in a Tkinter window.

This project consists of several scripts that work together to load, process, update, and display data.

Libraries Used :
* pandas
* sqlalchemy
* sqlite3
* tkinter
* unittest

Scripts
1- main.py
This is the main script for the project. 
It performs the following tasks:
    Setup Logging: Configures logging to record events and errors in a file named (project.log).
    Read Data: Loads data from CSV file and logs any issues that arise during this process.
    Process Data: Processes the loaded data and logs errors if the processing fails.
    Update Database: Updates SQL database with the processed data and logs whether the update was successful.

Requirements:
CSV file containing the data.
SQL database connection string (update connection_string with your actual database connection details).

*** Before running the script make sure that the file_path and connection_string are set correctly ***
*** Execute the script (python main.py) ***

2- data_processing.py
This is the data processing and database updates script for the project. 
Includes the following functions:
    Logging Setup: Configures logging to record events and errors in (project.log).
    read_csv_file Function: Reads data from CSV file into a DataFrame, handling various errors like file not found, empty file, parsing issues and encoding errors.
    process_data Function: Processes the DataFrame by converting columns to the appropriate types and adding a new calculated column. Logs successful processing or errors.
    update_sql_table Function: Updates SQL table with the processed data using SQLAlchemy. 
    Logs success or failure and returns a boolean indicating the result.

*** No direct execution is required *** 
*** This script is used internally and imported by other scripts. No direct execution is required ***

3- test_data_processing.py
This script is used for unit testing the functions in data_processing.py. 
It checks that data processing and database updates work as expected.
Includes the following functions:
    Data Processing Test: Verifies that the processed DataFrame is not empty, contains the TOTALVALUE column, and that this column is numeric.
    Database Update Test: Ensures that the update_sql_table function updates the SQL table successfully.

*** Execute the script  to verify functionality (python test_data_processing.py) ***

4-view_database.py
Displays data from the database in Tkinter window. 
Includes the following functions:
    Logging Setup: Configures logging to (project.log).
    fetch_data_from_db Function: Connects to SQLite database to retrieve data and column names.
    display_data_in_tkinter Function: Shows the data in a Tkinter window using a Treeview widget with support for sorting, row coloring, and scrollbars.
    sort_by_column Function: Sorts the Treeview data by the selected column.

*** Execute the script (python view_database.py) ***

Each script has been crafted to make your workflow smoother and more efficient. 
I drew inspiration from my own experience dealing with large datasets in previous projects.

While developing this project, I remembered a time when data presented a major challenge and I needed a quick solution.

I know that working with data can sometimes be complex but Iâ€™m confident that these tools will help simplify things.

If you encounter any difficulties try searching online often solutions are closer than you might think.

I hope this project helps streamline your data processing and visualization tasks and proves useful for you. 

This project uses a free and experimental dataset sourced from Kaggle. 
Please note that this data is for experimental purposes only and may not fully represent real-world data. 
For more information about the dataset and its usage you can visit the (https://www.kaggle.com/) 

If you have any suggestions or run into issues, I'd love to hear from you at (ahmadzl@hotmail.com). 
Thank you for using me project.
Enjoy working with your data!

*** Note:**
*** I have set up a Task Scheduler by named 'Data Processing and SQL Update Task' to run automatically at specific times. ***
*** That data processing and SQL database updates as scheduled. ***
